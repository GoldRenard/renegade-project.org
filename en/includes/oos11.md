## OxygenOS 11

!> OxygenOS 11 installed on the device may cause a lot of weird various issues including a **potential hard-brick** if you flash EDK2 to the boot image. Please to consider to downgrade to OOS 10 (and install any custom rom over it if you like) especially if you want to flash EDK2 to boot partition.
